# Quick Fix for Missing Images

To fix the loading issues on the index.html page, you need to add the missing image files to this directory. You have two options:

## Option 1: Add Your Own Images
Add your own image files with the exact filenames mentioned in the README.md file:
- carousel1.jpg, carousel2.jpg, carousel3.jpg, carousel4.jpg
- mountain-bike.jpg, road-bike.jpg, urban-bike.jpg, accessories.jpg
- bike1.jpg, bike2.jpg, bike3.jpg
- accessory1.jpg
- customer1.jpg, customer2.jpg
- And other images listed in README.md

## Option 2: Use Placeholder Images
1. Download placeholder images from a site like Unsplash, Pexels, or Pixabay
2. Rename them to match the required filenames
3. Place them in this directory

## Option 3: Use CSS to Hide Missing Images
If you can't add images right now, you can modify the CSS to prevent "broken image" icons from appearing:

```css
/* Add this to your css/styles.css file */
img:not([src]), img[src=""] {
  visibility: hidden;
}

/* For background images, you could use a fallback color */
.carousel-image {
  background-color: var(--primary-color);
}
```

Choose the option that works best for your situation!
